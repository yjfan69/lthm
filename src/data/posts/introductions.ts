## Love to Hate Me

Yellowjackets' vocalist, Shauna Shipman, is everyone's dream girlâ€¦ except Jackie Taylor's apparently. After the actress outright rejects her in public, Shauna decides to do everything she can to exact revenge.

## Shauna Shipman 

- vocalist and songwriter to Yellowjackets
- surprisingly, the one with the least social media presence among the trio
- that's good because she didn't pay attention to media training and will be prone to say things that would be a PR nightmare

## Natalie Scatorccio

- vocalist and guitarist
- somehow, the most stanned member because she actually does interact with fans (mostly through memes in her ig stories) 
- shaunanat is a huge ship in the fandom but she has no clue why

## Ben Scott

- manager of the yjs
- please pray for him bcs he will go through a lot (shauna being shauna) in this AU

- "all publicity is good publicity" he says as he cries himself to sleep

## And last but not the least (for now)...

Jackie Taylor

- the indie darling who is starting to go mainstream 
- fanbase mostly made up of lesbians bcs she kissed a girl once for a film and they are invested ever since
- a yellowjackets casual enjoyer (1 guess on who is her fave)
